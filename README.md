# HousingPrices-ML
Housing Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project explores the use of various machine learning regression techniques to predict housing prices based on data sourced from Zillow. The project evaluates multiple models, including linear regression, ensemble methods, and neural networks, to determine the most accurate and efficient method for predicting housing prices. The results provide valuable insights for real estate markets and stakeholders, enhancing decision-making and improving market transparency.

Project Structure

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python installed. Clone the repository and install the required packages using the following commands:


git clone https://github.com/Nishant27-2006/HousingPrices-ML.git
cd housing-price-prediction
Data Collection
The data used in this project was sourced from Zillow, including detailed information on housing characteristics such as location, size, and amenities. The dataset was enriched with additional features such as economic indicators and demographic data to improve the predictive accuracy of the models.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values using imputation techniques.
Scaling and normalizing features for uniformity.
Feature engineering to create additional variables from existing data.
Dimensionality reduction using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
The preprocessing code can be found in the scripts/preprocess_data.py file.

Modeling
The project employs several machine learning models, including:

Linear Models: Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet
Ensemble Methods: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
Support Vector Regression: SVR (Linear and RBF kernels)
Neural Networks: Feedforward Neural Network
The models are trained and evaluated using a combination of holdout validation and cross-validation techniques. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using grid search and random search.

The modeling code is organized in the scripts/model.py file.

Evaluation
Models are evaluated based on the following metrics:

R-squared (R²): Measures how well the model's predictions fit the actual data.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Provides an indication of the model's prediction accuracy.
Evaluation results, including residual plots and model comparison charts, are stored in the results/ directory.

Results
The project found that ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost, provided the best predictive accuracy, with reasonable R² scores and low RMSE values. Linear models and simpler algorithms like Ridge and Lasso struggled with the complexity of the data, leading to poorer performance.

Key findings and detailed analysis can be found in the results/ directory.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble methods for predicting housing prices. While simpler linear models failed to capture the non-linear relationships in the data, advanced ensemble techniques like CatBoost and Random Forest provided more accurate and reliable predictions.

Future Work
Future improvements to this project could include:

Incorporating more diverse data sources, such as social sentiment analysis or environmental factors.
Experimenting with hybrid models that combine the strengths of different machine learning techniques.
Applying advanced deep learning architectures, such as CNNs and RNNs, to better capture spatial and temporal dependencies in the data.
